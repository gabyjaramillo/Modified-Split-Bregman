% Split Bregman and Gradient Flow for Nonsmooth Nonconvex functionals
% Shankar Venkataramani & Gabriela Jaramillo

% E = int (u-u_k)^2/(2h) +W[u'] +V[u] dx  x in D

% Here W[u'] can be chosen to be the convex envelope of
% W1(d) = (d^2-1)^2 
% W2(d) = (d^2-1)^2 if d >= 0 and infty if d<0 
% W3(d) = (d^2-1)^2( (d-1)^2-1)^2 

% Also V[u] can be chosen to be
% V1[u] = u^2   
% V2[u] = (u^2-1)^2
% V3[u] = (u^2 -g(x))^2 


% We will assume that the function lives on the nodes, the derivative
% lives on the intervals between the nodes.
